## what you learned and what you are still confused about?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is ideal for creating and sharing text on the web. It is designed to be easier to write and read than most other formats. Markdown has many benefits such as being easy to write and read, easy to format, and easy to convert into other formats. It also allows the user to focus more on their content rather than formatting it. Some common uses of markdown include blogging, wikis, documents, email messages, source code listings, etc.***I have some confusion in syntax of markdown and fonts weights.***

I liked the most was a list of GitHub's top trending repositories.I like how easy it is to use and it is very informative. It also has a large number of users which makes it easier to find specific topics you are looking for.
## What would you like to see more of?
The GitHub community is one of the most active and diverse communities on the internet. It has over 40 million users and has a large number of open source projects.So I want to explore more about github community updates about new things.
## What would be helpful to your learning journey?
***Students can learn from other studentsâ€™ work, which helps them to be more creative in their own work.*** Teachers can also use GitHub to find resources on how to teach other subjects, or they can use it as an online class planner.
